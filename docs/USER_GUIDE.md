## Recurring Tasks

Recurring tasks automatically repeat on a schedule, saving you from manually recreating the same task.

### Creating a Recurring Task

1. Create or edit a task
2. Expand the "Recurring Pattern" section
3. Choose a pattern:
   - **Every day**: Repeats daily
   - **Every week**: Repeats weekly on the same day

   - **Every month**: Same date each month
   - **Every year**: Same date each year
   - **Custom**: Define your own pattern
4. Optionally set an end date
5. Save the task

### How Recurring Tasks Work

- When you complete a recurring task, a new instance is automatically created
- The new task has the same properties (name, description, priority, etc.)
- The date is calculated based on the pattern
- Original task is marked complete and archived

### Custom Patterns

For custom patterns, you can define:
- Specific days of the week
- Specific dates of the month
- Complex schedules

Example: "Every Monday and Thursday" or "1st and 15th of each month"

### Editing Recurring Tasks

**Edit One Instance**:
- Open the task and make changes
- Only that instance is affected

**Edit the Pattern**:
- Open the task
- Modify the recurring pattern
- Future instances will use the new pattern

### Stopping Recurrence

2. Remove the recurring pattern
3. Or set an end date in the past

### Subtask Display

- Subtasks appear nested under parent in task lists

### Best Practices

- Use subtasks for multi-step tasks
